ROC-Solver
==========

In Cellular Maufacturing System (CMS) or Group Technology, 
layout of machines are based on recognizing similarities in products – similarities in geometry, size, materials and processing requirements. 
The products on the basis of similarities are collected and “Grouped” instead of being treated as individuals. 
In this application the problem of clustering of Machines to build cells has been implemented using Rank Order Clustering Algorithm.
